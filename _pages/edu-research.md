## Research Experience

### Research Assistant  
Nazarbayev University, Kazakhstan  
*July 2022 – Present*  
Focus: Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Few-Shot Learning, Federated Learning, Edge Computing, Vision Transformers, Vision-Language Models.

### Key Projects

1. **Vision-Language Models for Aerial Video Classification**  
   Adapted CLIP and other vision-language models to aerial video datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in action detection for zero-shot, few-shot, and supervised settings.

2. **Federated Few-Shot Action Recognition**  
   Integrated few-shot learning with federated learning frameworks, enhancing performance in federated settings using meta-learning techniques on transformer-based models.

3. **Few-Shot Learning for Action Recognition with Video Transformers**  
   Developed a few-shot action recognition framework leveraging Transformer-based backbones, self-supervised pretraining, and optimized few-shot performance on custom datasets.

4. **Transformer-Based Multi-Stream Human Action Recognition**  
   Built multi-stream models using RGB, optical flow, and skeletal data, achieving near-state-of-the-art results with transfer learning and keyframe sampling.

5. **Facial Expression Recognition on Edge Systems**  
   Designed a FER framework optimized for edge devices, combining deep learning and edge computing to achieve real-time emotion recognition on resource-constrained devices.
